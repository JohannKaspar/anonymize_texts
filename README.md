# Anonymization of Names
This code implements an anonymization algorithm for names in text. The algorithm works by replacing names with generic terms such as "Person 1", "Person 2" etc. The algorithm is designed to identify names in a given text or file, and replace them with generic terms while preserving the structure of the sentence. 

The code begins by loading a Sequence Tagger model to identify names in a sentence. This is followed by splitting the text into a list of sentences, and then predicting tags for the sentences. It then creates a list of all entities and their positions in the text. The algorithm then identifies the most common name (most likely the patient's name) and creates a dictionary of real names and their anonymized equivalents. It is then further refined to account for substrings, by ensuring that if the name is a substring in another name, they are anonymized to the same generic term. 

The last step is to replace the names in the text with the anonymized terms. This is done by using the entity's start and end positions in the text, and replacing the corresponding part with the anonymized version. Finally, the processed text is returned.

The code also includes a parser that can be used to provide a filename or text as an argument. This provides flexibility in how the algorithm can be used. 

This code can be used to anonymize sensitive information such as names while preserving the structure of the text. This is especially useful in cases such as medical records, where patient data needs to be anonymized for privacy reasons.
